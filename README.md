XBSX2 is a free and open-source PlayStation 2 (PS2) emulator. Its purpose is to emulate the PS2's hardware, using a combination of MIPS CPU [Interpreters](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)>), [Recompilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_recompilation) and a [Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) which manages hardware states and PS2 system memory. This allows you to play PS2 games on your PC, with many additional features and benefits.

## Maintenance
I will maintain this project as time permits, and new builds may be released approximately every three months or so. Please do not contact me asking for updates, as there are no ETAs. Updates are published on a case-by-case basis based on availability and need.

If you are in need of a build, check the [**Actions**](https://github.com/EmulationCollective/XBSX2/actions/workflows/buildwinrtnightly.yml) tab to find the latest available build. Please note that those builds are nightly and have not been tested.

## System Requirements

We recommend to use an Xbox Series S or Xbox Series X with XBSX2 but you can however play a limited set of games on Xbox One, Xbox One S, and Xbox One X.

Please note that a BIOS dump from a legitimately-owned PS2 console is required to use the emulator. For more information, visit [this page](https://pcsx2.net/docs/setup/gather/#how-to-dump-your-ps2-bios)

## Building
